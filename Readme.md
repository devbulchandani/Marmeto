   - If using Git, clone the repository using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/mmdmrishabh/Coding-assessment-l2-Boilerplate-code.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it.

   - Border in images tab: The images in the image tabs (`<div class="image-tabs">`) lack proper borders. You can add borders to the images using CSS to enhance their visual appearance and distinguish them from the background.

4. **Deployment:**
